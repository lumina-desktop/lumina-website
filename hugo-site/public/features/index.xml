    <title>Features of Lumina :: Lumina Desktop Environment</title>
    <link>http://localhost:45831/features/index.html</link>
    <description>The Lumina速 desktop is designed to be fast, customizable, flexible, and lightweight. Lumina速 works great in multi-monitor configurations and with high-resolution monitors (4K+) as well as single-screen configurations on laptops or tablets. Lumina is designed to work out-of-box without end-user apps and requires fewer dependencies than most other desktop environments. The Lumina速 desktop does not require PolicyKit, HAL, or systemd. This makes Lumina速 very portable and the desktop can be run on most flavors of BSD and GNU/Linux.</description>
