After more than 7 years of work, I have decided that it is time to let others take over the development of the Lumina Desktop project going forward. It has been an incredible task which has pushed me into areas of development that I had never previously considered. However, with work and life changes, my time for developing new functionality for Lumina has become nearly non-existent, particularly for the Qt5 -> Qt6 change that will be coming within the next year or so.
By passing the torch over to JT ([q5sys on GitHub](https://github.com/q5sys)), I am hoping that the project might receive more timely updates, for the benefit of everyone.

Thank you all, and I hope for the continued success of the Lumina Desktop project!!
