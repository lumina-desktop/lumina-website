The Lumina® desktop is designed to be fast, customizable, flexible, and lightweight. Lumina® works great in multi-monitor configurations and with high-resolution monitors (4K+) as well as single-screen configurations on laptops or tablets.
Lumina is designed to work out-of-box without end-user apps and requires fewer dependencies than most other desktop environments. The Lumina® desktop does not require PolicyKit, HAL, or systemd. This makes Lumina® very portable and the desktop can be run on most flavors of BSD and GNU/Linux.

## Desktop Features

### Quick and Easy to Configure
Quickly and easily change your display and theming settings using the Lumina® configuration utility (`lumina-config` on the command-line). It is also a fully-featured desktop configuration where nearly every single item on the desktop can be changed or customized as desired.

* All desktop configuration files are simple plain-text files on the back-end.
* Desktop will dynamically detect configuration changes to adjust as needed.
* Appearance profiles can easily be used to reproduce the look and feel of other common desktop systems.
* Custom appearance profiles can also be created/used.

   * Customize the right-click desktop context menu
      * Shortcuts to any/all applications
      * Launch basic apps (default terminal or file manager)
      * Provide a task manager for the true desktop minimalists
      * Provide a way to run user-created "menu scripts" to dynamically generate new types of context menu items.

### Fast and Responsive
Lumina® is extremely minimal and can be used on systems with as little as 1GB of memory. It is very self-contained and does not require any particular utilities or libraries aside from very a small handful.
Lumina is designed around the concept of complete modularity. Your applications are completely independent from the desktop itself and can be added/removed at will without loss of functionality.

## Optional Stand-Alone Utilities
There are many utilities that are developed alongside the Lumina desktop to ensure that a full range of functionality is available if nothing other than the Lumina desktop and utilities are installed. Each of these utilities is available independently of the desktop and can be built or used as a separate stand-alone utility on other desktops or operating systems as desired. These utilities may have special integration options when used in conjunction with the Lumina desktop however.
