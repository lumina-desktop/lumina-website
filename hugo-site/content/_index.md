### Lightweight Desktop Environment
   * Lumina is designed to have a small footprint, giving your system the best performance possible.

### Intuitive Layout
   * Lumina is built to flow seamlessly between computer tasks and offers several integrated utilities in one convenient package.

### Completely Customizable
   * Nearly everything in the interface can be configured to suit the individual workflow. From desktop icons and single-application systems to multi-monitor arrangements or a plethora of self-contained workspaces, Lumina can do it all.

### Freely Available
   * Lumina is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license, allowing it to be used by anyone, anywhere (including in proprietary distributions).

### Lumina has been written from scratch
   * Written in C++/Qt5 and is not based on any existing desktop’s code-base, and does not use any of the Linux-based desktop frameworks (ConsoleKit, PolicyKit, D-Bus, systemd, etc..)

### Lumina uses a simple built-in interface layer
   * Communicate directly with the operating system (which is the only class specific to the operating system – making it simple to port/customize). Allows Lumina® to obtain system information in a fast and efficient manner while ensuring desktop stability and reliability.
