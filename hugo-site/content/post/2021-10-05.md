### Yes the project is still alive.

And in fact there's been a release!  
[Lumina Desktop v1.6.1](https://github.com/lumina-desktop/lumina/releases/tag/v1.6.1)

It's only been 611 days... that's not too long right?  

Anyway onto the point, yes the project is still alive and there's been some updates. This release encompases two main things.  

First is a collection of minor fixes that have gone into master since 1.6.0 came out, along with some translation updates.  This includes two small additional binaries for use by the desktop.  

Second is that the downstream theme work that we did for Project Trident is now in Lumina as the default theme.

### Note to Packagers:

As of this version there is an additional dependency on the La Capitaine Icon Theme. The fallback old Google Material Design Icon Themes are still included for OSes and distros without a package for La Capitaine, however we are planning on eventually removing them at some point in the future. For more information on that icon theme, see the updated Core [ReadMe] for a link to that icon themes' github repo.

### Community Links

Lastly, we do have some community channels for interaction.  I cant remember when we made the Telegram channel, but the Matrix channel is new.  They are bridged so you only need to join one, but if you'd like to stay up to date with the project, feel free to join either.
