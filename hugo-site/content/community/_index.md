## Themes!
There is a community repository for providing new theme files, color schemes, wallpapers, and more!
[This repository](https://github.com/lumina-desktop/lumina-themes) is available on GitHub and contains all the instructions necessary to help you get started.
 
## Get Involved!
* If you are a C++/Qt developer, there are tons of areas where you could contribute! 
   * Finding/fixing bugs
   * Writing new interface plugins
   * Adding functionality to existing plugins
   * and more!
* If you are a CSS developer, then you might be interested in making new themes for Lumina® (using QSS: it is very similar to CSS but specifically for Qt applications/widgets). 
   * These themes can be created/modified directly within the Lumina® theme engine utility and get applied to all Qt5-based applications.
* This website!
   * This website is a simple one created using the "Hugo" static-site generator. All of the sources for this site are managed and run from our [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/lumina-desktop/lumina-desktop.github.io) and changes are always welcome!
* If you found a bug or have an idea for a cool new feature, you can post bug reports or feature requests on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lumina-desktop/lumina).
